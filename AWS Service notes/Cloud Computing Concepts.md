# ☁️ Cloud Computing Concepts (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner)

## 1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet** with pay-as-you-go pricing.  
You rent computing power, storage, and databases from providers like **AWS** instead of owning servers.

### 🔹 Benefits
- **Agility:** Quickly adapt to changes.  
- **Elasticity:** Scale up/down with demand.  
- **Cost Savings:** Pay only for what you use.  
- **Global Reach:** Deploy globally in minutes.
