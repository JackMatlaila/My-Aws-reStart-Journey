# 🌟 My Cloud Journey – Onalenna Jack Matlaila



Hey there! I’m **Onalenna Jack Matlaila**, and I’m diving into the world of cloud computing through **AWS re/Start**.  
I come from a background in telecommunications and electrical engineering, and now I’m learning to build, manage, and deploy cloud infrastructure.

This repo is my **learning playground** — where I jot down notes, practice labs, try mini-projects, and track my progress through the program.

## 🌩️ About the Program

AWS re/Start is a **hands-on, full-time program** that helps people get ready for entry-level cloud jobs.  

I’m getting experience in:

- AWS Core Services: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, CloudWatch  
- Linux administration and command-line skills  
- Python programming for automation  
- Networking basics and troubleshooting  
- SQL & NoSQL databases  
- Security practices in cloud environments  
- Teamwork, communication, and professional growth

> This is my **personal cloud notebook**. I’m constantly adding to it as I learn, experiment, and make mistakes (because that’s where the real learning happens). If you’re curious about cloud or want to see my labs, you’re in the right place! 🚀
